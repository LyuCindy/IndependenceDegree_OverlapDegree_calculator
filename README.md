## IndependenceDegree_OverlapDegree_calculator
   Quantification of two adsorption behaviors discovered by big data mining
## Software function：
   The software quantifies the distribution of adsorption positions of two molecular clusters in the nanoporous material, and can intuitively judge their adsorption distances by the degree of independence and overlap.
## Steps to use the software
     1.Input atomic three-dimensional coordinate files of all molecules in two molecular clusters into the software respectively.
       The following is an example of A molecular cluster coordinate file. Example file format:“A.txt”
            14.686 20.112 8.942
            14.420 20.368 9.513
            14.700 19.910 9.004

            14.247 20.463 9.788
            14.531 20.146 9.183
            14.420 20.501 9.794
            14.614 20.126 9.186
            14.476 20.528 9.091
            14.809 20.072 8.613
            14.415 20.471 9.861
            14.788 20.139 9.314
            14.392 20.570 9.297
            14.783 20.111 8.868
            14.314 20.378 9.197
            14.641 19.951 8.689
            14.422 20.564 9.413
            14.839 20.205 8.918
            14.349 20.535 9.309
     2.Enter the threshold value and click calculation to obtain the percentage of overlap degree and independence degree between the adsorption positions of two molecular clusters
## Note: 
     If the distance between each molecule in two molecular clusters is too far for competitive adsorption to exist, it will directly indicate "No competitive adsorption occupancy phenomenon".
     If each molecule in two molecular clusters is too close to each other to have independent occupying phenomenon, the direct indication is "No independent occupancy phenomenon".
